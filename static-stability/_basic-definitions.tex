\section{Basic Definitions}
\textbf{Trimability:} The ability of an aircraft to be placed in a desired equilibrium state by a pilot manipulating the controls.

\textbf{Static Stability:} The immediate tendency of a system to return or deviate from its equilibrium, following a perturbation.
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Statically Stable:} natural tendency to return to it equilibrium state
  \item \textbf{Neutrally Stable:} remain in that perturbed state
  \item \textbf{Statically Unstable:} diverge away from previous equilibrium
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Dynamic Stability:} The long-term tendency of a system following a perturbation.
