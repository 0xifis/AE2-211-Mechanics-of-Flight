\section{Trimmed Flight}
It refers to the state of the aircraft where it remains in equilibrium, at a fixed airspeed and flight path gradient, without continuous manipulation of the controls by the pilot.

And an aircraft is in equilibrium when
\begin{equation}
  \sum \vec{F} = \sum \begin{bmatrix} F_x \\ F_y\\ F_z \\\end{bmatrix}= 0 
  \quad\text{and}\quad 
  \sum \vec{M} = 0 = \sum \begin{bmatrix} M_x \\ M_y\\ M_z \\\end{bmatrix}= 0 
\end{equation}
\subsection{Assumptions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The fuselage generate no aerodynamic forces minus drag.
  \item All aerodynamic forces act through the aircraft's CG.
  \item Thrust acts through the powerplant centreline and is a function of altitude and $V_{\infty}$ only.
  \item The aircraft's weight acts through the CG and always downwards.
\end{enumerate}
